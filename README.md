This is an [assignment](https://github.com/yrgo/wu17/tree/master/JavaScript/07%20-%20Fuzzy%20Memory) for the Javascript course, where I will make a concentration game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## How to play
1. Clone repo using [this link](https://github.com/majapersson/fuzzy_memory.git) in GitHub Desktop,
`$ git clone https://github.com/majapersson/fuzzy_memory.git` in bash or by visiting https://majapersson.github.io/fuzzy_memory/
2. Open index.html in your browser (preferrably Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox)
3. Choose difficulty
4. Play the game

## Rules
- Click on any card on the board and it will reveal a picture
- Try to find the corresponding card
- If the cards match, they will stay revealed and if they didn't, they will flip back and you can try again
- When all cards have been revealed and are lying face up, the game is won!
- You can reset the game at any time by pressing the 'Reset'-button
